 * An array is a group of some predefined number of elements.

 * Or, we could have an array of our own custom Objects, such as our own Bird class for a birdwatching
 * application. This would allow us to keep track of many birds and their own behavior.

 * For the following problems, all of the syntax we need is in this documentation:
